# Next.js

Next.js is a backend framework for your React applications.

## Why should I use it?

Pairing Next.js with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) makes developing and deploying web apps easier than ever before. Their extremely generous free-tier and super intuitive interface provides a point and click solution to deploy your site.

## Get Static/Server Props

A key feature of Next.js is its data fetching capabilities. We highly recommend reading through the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching) to understand how to use each method and how they differ. `getServerSideProps` is generally discouraged unless there is a good reason for it, due to the fact that it is a blocking call and will slow down your site. [Incremental Static Regeneration](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration) is a great alternative to `getServerSideProps` when the data is dynamic and can be fetched incrementally.
